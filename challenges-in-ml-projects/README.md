## Examples of Challanges in ML Projects

| **Example**                          | **Challenges**                                                                                                   | **Proposed Solutions**                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Predictive Maintenance**           | - **Accuracy**: Imbalanced dataset as failures are rare, leading to a high risk of false negatives.             | - Use simple undersampling of the majority class to balance the dataset and improve failure detection accuracy.                                                  |
|                                      | - **Latency**: Predictions must be made within seconds to trigger real-time maintenance alerts.                 | - Deploy lightweight models like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees for faster predictions.                                                                  |
|                                      | - **Cost**: Sensor data collection and processing for thousands of machines can be computationally expensive.   | - Downsample data by aggregating sensor readings to reduce storage and compute costs.                                                                           |
| **Fraud Detection**                  | - **Accuracy**: Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones, causing class imbalance.          | - Apply a weighted classification approach (e.g., increasing the penalty for misclassifying the minority class) to address imbalance.                           |
|                                      | - **Latency**: Predictions must be generated within 100 milliseconds to avoid delays in transaction processing. | - Use a Random Forest model with fewer estimators to balance speed and accuracy.                                                                                |
|                                      | - **Cost**: Managing and storing large amounts of transaction data increases costs.                             | - Pre-filter transactions with simple rule-based heuristics before applying the ML model.                                                                       |
| **Customer Churn Prediction System** | - **Accuracy**: Imbalanced data as most customers are retained, while only a small percentage churn.            | - Use oversampling of the minority class (churned customers) by duplicating examples within the training set.                                                   |
|                                      | - **Latency**: Predictions must fit within a weekly ETL processing window.                                      | - Train a Decision Tree or Random Forest for interpretable and moderately accurate results.                                                                      |
|                                      | - **Cost**: Scaling storage and compute as the customer base grows.                                             | - Aggregate customer behavior data into summary statistics (e.g., average transactions) to reduce storage requirements.                                         |
