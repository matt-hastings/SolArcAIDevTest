This template serves as a guide for updating lessons based on the learning design principles observed in the exemplar lesson "Quick Refresher for ML v2.0". Use this template as a reference when improving the remaining lessons to ensure consistency and alignment with best practices in learning design.

Be sure not to change the learning objectives for any given lesson. 
BE sure not to add in too much more content. 
Be sure not to add emojis! And where you see them remove them!
Please be sure to break up large code blocks into smaller ones with conceptual sign posting.

## Transformation Guide

### Learning Objectives

#### Before:
```
**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to describe supervised machine learning approach and list the major algorithms used for supervised machine learning.
```

#### After:
```
**Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Implement foundational machine learning algorithms across supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning categories.
- Interpret the output of these algorithms and relate it to business decision-making.
- Build intuition for selecting the right algorithm based on the problem type.
```

### Content Structure

#### Before:
Separate sections for each algorithm with theoretical explanations:
```
| [- Linear Regression](./linear-regression/README.md) | Optional | Describe linear regression algorithms used for supervised machine learning.|
| [- Logistic Regression](./logistic-regression/README.md) | Optional | Describe logistic regression algorithms used for supervised machine learning.|
| [- Decision Trees](./decision-trees/README.md) | Optional | Describe decision tree algorithms used for supervised machine learning.|
```

#### After:
Integrated section with practical examples of multiple algorithms applied to the same business problem:
```
## 1. Supervised Learning
### a. Linear Regression (Predicting Monthly Spend)
Linear regression predicts a continuous numeric value based on input features.

**Business Application Example:** Estimating a customer's future monthly spend based on their age.

### Code Example:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = data[['Age']]
y = data['MonthlySpend']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

prediction = model.predict([[35]])
print(f"Predicted Monthly Spend for Age 35: ${prediction[0]:.2f}")
```

### Key Takeaway:
Linear regression is most effective for numeric predictions when data has a linear relationship.
```

### Visual Elements

#### Before:
Text-heavy explanation with few visual aids:
```
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to automatically learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on creating algorithms that can:

- Recognize patterns
- Make decisions
- Solve problems based on input data
```

#### After:
Visual representation with diagrams:
```
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing specific rules for every possible outcome, ML systems identify patterns in data to generate insights and automate decision-making.

✅ **Traditional programming**: Rules + Data → Output\
✅ **Machine learning**: Data + Output → Model (learned rules)

</div>
```

### Practical Examples

#### Before:
Theoretical explanation without practical implementation:
```
**Core Concept:**\
Linear regression predicts continuous outcomes by modeling the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a target variable. The model finds the best-fit line (or hyperplane) by minimizing the error between predicted and actual values.

**ShopSmart Example:**\
Imagine ShopSmart wants to forecast monthly sales revenue. By analyzing past data on advertising spend, website traffic, and seasonal trends, linear regression can predict future revenue---helping the team plan budgets and optimize marketing efforts.
```

#### After:
Practical code example with business context:
```
### a. Linear Regression (Predicting Monthly Spend)
Linear regression predicts a continuous numeric value based on input features.

**Business Application Example:** Estimating a customer's future monthly spend based on their age.

### Code Example:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = data[['Age']]
y = data['MonthlySpend']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

prediction = model.predict([[35]])
print(f"Predicted Monthly Spend for Age 35: ${prediction[0]:.2f}")
```

### Key Takeaway:
Linear regression is most effective for numeric predictions when data has a linear relationship.
```

### Interactive Components

#### Before:
Passive learning with few interactive elements:
```
Machine Learning Limitations
Machine learning, despite its remarkable capabilities, has several limitations that can affect its performance and applicability in real-world scenarios.  

### Data-Dependent Nature
- Machine learning models rely heavily on the quality and quantity of data.  
- Poor-quality data, including noise, missing values, or biases, can lead to inaccurate predictions.  
- The availability of labeled data for supervised learning tasks can be a bottleneck.  
```

#### After:
Interactive exercise with discussion prompts:
```
## Reflection Exercise
You will be placed into breakout rooms in pairs. **Discuss the following questions with your partner**:
  - *Have you ever experienced or observed a flawed decision driven by poor data or technology?*
  - *Which of these limitations do you think would be most critical in your organization or industry?*

Be prepared to share a quick insight from your discussion when you return to the main room.
```

### Business Context

#### Before:
Technical focus with limited business context:
```
### Unsupervised Machine Learning  
   - Works with unlabeled data for clustering (customer segmentation) and dimensionality reduction (PCA).  
   - Applied in anomaly detection, market basket analysis, and data exploration.  
   - Used in marketing, cybersecurity, and biological research.  
```

#### After:
Business-focused explanation with clear applications:
```
### 2\. Unsupervised Learning

-   The model is trained on unlabeled data. It identifies patterns, groupings, or structures without knowing the correct outputs.

**Common Algorithms:** K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Business Applications:**

-   Customer segmentation
-   Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)
-   Market basket analysis (product recommendations based on purchase behavior)

**Key Distinction:** There is no predefined outcome; the goal is to uncover hidden patterns.

```

### Case Studies and Exercises

#### Before:
Role-playing activity with external resources:
```
## Role-Play Activity Setup
Divide participants into pairs or small groups. One person acts as the **consultant**, and the other(s) act as the **client**.

> Consultants - [here is your consultant brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jRD0RHsAdgntobjRJdmkdQ22uc6gUGMGh2Lc67aKR4/edit?tab=t.0).

> Clients - [here are the scenarios you can choose from](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GNzBn9XW-yc93q5pDTXQNc5l8E7dea9qNMxH5VOBLEE/view). 
```

#### After:
Integrated case study with clear instructions and business context:
```
## Business Scenario

**Improving Customer Retention at a Subscription-Based Streaming Service**

A leading streaming service is experiencing an increase in customer cancellations (churn). The company wants to understand which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions in the near future and proactively offer discounts or tailored content to retain them.

Your group has been tasked with recommending an initial machine learning approach to help address this challenge.

*Consider the following*:

- What data points might help predict whether a customer will churn (e.g., viewing habits, subscription history, demographics, support inquiries)?
- Is the goal to predict future churn, group customers, or optimize offers over time?

## Group Deliverable

Be prepared to explain:

- Your recommended ML approach (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement).
- A brief justification for your choice.
- Examples of the types of data that would be critical for this model to work.
```
