## About

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Define the concept and significance of the ML workflow, identifying its key components and their interrelationships.
- Formulate machine learning problems by aligning them with specific business objectives and goals.
- Apply data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis techniques to prepare datasets for modeling.
- Evaluate models effectively using train-test splits and cross-validation, assessing their performance and reliability.
